# check csv function
    # check column name

    # check for data types
    
    # check for max length in each column
    max(nchar(waypoints$Lat_DD))

    # check for duplicates

    # check for null values

    # GOAL: output a table that has the column name and the
    # number of objects, duplicates, nulls, max length, and 
    # the data types for each column in the table

    # eventually be able to pull all of the tables in a file 
    # and export them to another file that has them summarized
